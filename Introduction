With the rapid growth of digital transactions such as UPI, credit cards, and online banking, fraud has become a major concern. Fraudulent transactions cause huge financial losses to banks and customers. Manual detection is slow and inefficient.
Machine Learning provides automated systems that can analyze transaction patterns and detect fraud quickly and accurately.
This project develops a Machine Learning model to identify fraudulent online payment transactions.
